<h2>Create Database in mLab</h2>  
First, create a database and copy the connection link in './connection/mLab.js' (inside of template string)<br />
Don't forget to do the following changes,<br />

<br />
<h2>Structure of .env file</h2>
<br />
<pre>PORT = 4000
  
  // Replace the following by creating a user in mLab Database in Users Tab
  USER = ####
  PASS = $$$$
</pre>
<br />
<h2>Starting the server</h2><br />
in the CMD, enter <b>"npm intsall"</b><br />

You're good to go<br />
